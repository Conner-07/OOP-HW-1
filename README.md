This project is designed to manage a virtual inventory for a union of used car shops. It includes two main classes: Car and Seller. 
The Car class represents individual cars with attributes like make, model, year, mileage, engine, and price, along with methods to modify these attributes, such as painting, repairing, and adjusting the price. 
The Seller class manages an inventory of Car objects, allowing cars to be bought and sold. 
The project also includes functionality to load car data from a CSV file. 
The design focuses on simplicity and flexibility, with some limitations in error handling and part replacement options. 
The system serves as a basic but expandable tool for car inventory management.
